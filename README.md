Market Validation and Market Share of The Last Mile Delivery Space In Nigeria

Last mile delivery is the movement of goods from a transportation hub to the final delivery destination - the final delivery destination is typically a personal residence.

Last mile logistics has become a popular area of interest for retailers in Nigeria due to the growing demand for fully integrated omnichannel retailing. Evolving omnichannel needs have forced retailers to evaluate current transportation network capabilities and make adjustments accordingly.

Last mile delivery is becoming more important than ever due to the surge of online orders in Nigeria. 
E-commerce sales are expected to reach â‚¦401.35 million  by 2023, an increase of 28.8% from 2017. These expected 
increases span across a variety of product types including apparel, entertainment, food, health & beauty, electronics and more.

In this project, I'll be working with three data sets, namely - a data set containing:

1. The Penetration of Companies into the Last Mile Delivery Space from 2008-2019 in Nigeria

2. The Annual Compound Revenues for Last Mile Delivery Companies from 2008-2019 in Nigeria

3. The Sample of The Last Mile Delivery Market Share in Nigeria

These data set were aggregated from the financial situation of various (sample) Last Mile Delivery companies from 2008 - 2019

In this project, I'll analyse the Market Situation of the Last Mile Delivery Space in Nigeria by representing these various data points derived from the data set with a finely-created bar plot & a pie chart and I'll draw some conclusions based on these plots
